# About Project
As we all started working from house because of situation with virus, we all started to look more in our monitors as we dont have people near to have chit-chat with them time to time. 
So our eyes began to suffer more than they should, ranging from eye pain to migraines. I started looking for a way to solve this problem and came across 20-20-20 rule which seems to help with eye strain and headaches, so i made a cross platform app in electron to make sure work and rest time is well managed.

# What is 20-20-20 rule?
20-20-20 rule simply means for every 20 minutes of work you rest for 20 seconds and look away for 20 feet.
